# Term Bank

TermBank is an application that allows users to store and categorize terms and definitions.
Users may easily create, edit, and delete these selections.

# Filtering

Users may filter a list of all existing entries alphabetically, date added (newest), date added (oldest), and by category.
I plan to enhance this feature by providing progress tracking.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
