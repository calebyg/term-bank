# Term Bank

TermBank is an application that allows users to store and categorize terms and definitions. Users may easily create,
edit, and delete these selections.

My motivation for starting this project stems from my interest in becoming a full-stack developer
and learning the unique frameworks and libraries that are responsible for the many robust applications we use frequently.

## Filtering

Users may filter a list of all existing entries alphabetically, date added (newest), date added (oldest), and by category.

## Components

This project follows a component-based architecture that allows me to reuse chunks of JSX code and its added functionality throughout
the entire web page. Each React component has a significant role in the process of data entry, filtering, and other CRUD operations.

## What's next?

I plan to add database management and a tracking system for users to monitor their progress.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
